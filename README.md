# Singularity container for STAR 2.4.1a

Bioinformatics related singularity container recipe. 

Base is CentOS 8.

Currently two containers are implemented: 
 - STAR 2.4.1a
 - Note, automated Singularity Hub build does not seem to work correctly as this recipe uses multistage build to minimize container size

## Availability

Basic tools container is available at Singularity hub: shub://thakk/biobase

Building in singlurity-hub.org
